# Stat159-lab5
Lab 5 for 10/3/16



UserA; Bryan Alcorn
UserB: Joella Shane 


### Task 1:

Here we are working on the master branch are in sync. No pushes and commits happen without us coordinating pushing and pulling on the master branch


### Task 2: 

We see conflicts because we both modified file2 on the master branch. User B cannot overwrite them on the repo. To fix the conflcit, user B need to pull and hten fix the merge conflict. 


### Task 3

Since user B had changes to the master branch, it will still conflict with the changes user A made on the master branch, even though the changes were made on the other branch. The merge in effect will change the master.

### Task 4:

We modified different files. The repo was okay because we did not interfere with each others pushes. 

### Task 5: We modify the same file and both of us merge back to master. This is the same case as when we both modify the same file and try to push. It will cause a problem because there are conflicts at the origin.
